# All Code Aggregator

## Overview

The **All Code Aggregator** script consolidates all programming-related code files in the current directory into a single `full_code.txt` file. This is especially useful for providing your entire codebase to AI models for analysis or assistance.

## Features

- **Directory Tree Generation**: Creates an ASCII representation of the directory structure, excluding specified directories.
- **Code Aggregation**: Combines contents of programming-related files into a master file.
- **Customizable Inclusions/Exclusions**: Easily specify which files or directories to include or exclude.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

## Exclusions

The **All Code Aggregator** script automatically excludes specific directories and files to streamline the aggregation process and avoid including unnecessary or sensitive information.

### Excluded Directories

The following directories are excluded by default:

- `venv`
- `node_modules`
- `__pycache__`
- `.git`
- `dist`
- `build`
- `temp`
- `old_files`
- `flask_session`

**Purpose**: These directories are typically used for virtual environments, dependencies, build artifacts, version control, or temporary files that are not part of the core codebase.
